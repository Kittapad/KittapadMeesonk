Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms are rapidly growing as alternative options to traditional financial
institutions. A primary concern in P2P lending platforms is trustworthiness between borrowers and
lenders. Credit risk assessment can help lenders (investors) evaluate the loan default risk, and the
accurate credit risk models require advanced techniques to develop. The development of accurate
credit risk models using machine learning algorithms has emerged due to their ability to identify
complex patterns within extensive datasets.

In this paper, we utilize data from Bondora, a leading European peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform,
to examine the predictive power of machine learning models: Logistic Regression (LR), Random
Forests (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and XGBoost, in evaluating loan default risk. We
evaluate each model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC metrics.

Additionally, this study will evaluate the performance of two feature selection methods: Recursive
Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation using Random Forest (RFECV-RF) and Ranking
Importance Score using XGBoost (XGBoost-based ranking).

The result demonstrates that XGBoost with the RFECV-RF feature selection method model achieved
the highest performance, based on accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC metrics, with values
of 0.77, 0.76, 0.80, and 0.85, respectively. In addition, considering the performance of both feature
selection methods (RFECV-RF and XGBoost-based ranking), both feature selection methods yield
similar results when applied to the four machine learning algorithms. This study demonstrates that
XGBoost with the RFECV-RF feature selection method is the most accurate model for predicting
default risk on the Bondora P2P lending platform, based on our experimental results. This finding
can significantly benefit lenders (investors) by enabling more accurate default risk assessment and
strengthening their decision-making.
